# Player Stock - Enhanced Tokenomics System

A revolutionary player token protocol that implements **robust staking and burn mechanics** with direct relationships between player performance (PPR) and token economics. This system goes far beyond simple weekly burns to create a sophisticated performance-based economy that rewards consistency, punishes volatility, and creates natural price discovery through supply mechanics.

## üöÄ Core Innovations

### 1. **Direct PPR-to-Burn Relationship**
- **Meaningful Supply Impact**: 1-10% of circulating supply burned weekly based on performance
- **Performance-Based Scaling**: Burn rates scale directly with player performance vs league average
- **Supply Separation**: Clear distinction between circulating and locked supply

### 2. **Advanced Performance Analytics**
- **8-Week Rolling History**: Tracks performance over 8 weeks for stability
- **Standard Deviation Analysis**: Rewards players who perform above league average
- **Variance Penalty**: Penalizes inconsistent performers regardless of average
- **League-Wide Statistics**: Real-time calculation of league averages and distributions

### 3. **Sophisticated Staking Mechanics**
- **Performance-Frozen Multipliers**: Staking rewards locked at time of stake
- **Tiered Reward System**: 20-200% multipliers based on performance tiers
- **Variance Impact**: High variance players get reduced staking rewards
- **Supply Tracking**: Staked tokens move from circulating to locked supply

## üìä Enhanced Tokenomics System

### Performance-to-Burn Formula
```
performanceRatio = playerPerformanceScore / leagueAveragePPR

if (performanceRatio >= 100) {
    // Above average = BURN from treasury (deflationary)
    burnPercentage = calculateBurnPercentage(performanceRatio)
    burnAmount = protocolTreasury * burnPercentage / 10000
} else {
    // Below average = EMIT to treasury (inflationary, limited)
    emissionPercentage = calculateEmissionPercentage(performanceRatio)
    emissionAmount = protocolTreasury * emissionPercentage / 10000
}
```

### Burn Percentage Calculation
- **Base Target**: 5% of circulating supply per week
- **Performance Scaling**: 1-10% based on performance ratio
- **Maximum Burn**: 10% of supply per week (prevents excessive deflation)
- **Minimum Burn**: 1% of supply per week (ensures meaningful impact)

### Example Burn Scenarios
- **Average Performer** (100% of league average): 5% burn
- **Elite Performer** (150% of league average): 7.5% burn
- **Superstar** (200% of league average): 10% burn (capped)
- **Below Average** (80% of league average): 1% emission
- **Poor Performer** (50% of league average): 2% emission (capped)

## üéØ Advanced Performance Scoring

### Performance Score Formula
```
baseScore = playerAveragePPR
deviationBonus = calculateStandardDeviationBonus(player, league)
variancePenalty = calculateVariancePenalty(player, league)
performanceScore = baseScore + deviationBonus - variancePenalty
```

### Standard Deviation Bonus
- **Above Average**: 150% bonus for 1 standard deviation above mean
- **Below Average**: 50% bonus for 1 standard deviation below mean
- **Scaling**: Linear scaling based on deviation magnitude

### Variance Penalty
- **High Variance**: Up to 75% penalty for inconsistent performance
- **Normalized**: Variance calculated relative to league average
- **Protection**: Prevents negative performance scores

## üîí Enhanced Staking System

### Performance-Frozen Multipliers
When a user stakes tokens, the performance multiplier is **frozen at that moment** and remains constant for the duration of the stake. This prevents gaming the system and rewards early believers.

### Tiered Multiplier System
```
if (performanceRatio >= 120%) {
    // Elite tier: 150-200% multiplier
    multiplier = 150 + (performanceRatio - 120) * 5
} else if (performanceRatio >= 100%) {
    // Above average: 100-150% multiplier
    multiplier = 100 + (performanceRatio - 100) * 2.5
} else if (performanceRatio >= 80%) {
    // Below average: 50-100% multiplier
    multiplier = 100 - (100 - performanceRatio) * 2.5
} else {
    // Poor performers: 20-50% multiplier
    multiplier = 50 - (80 - performanceRatio) * 1.5
}
```

### Variance Impact on Staking
- **High Variance Penalty**: Up to 25% reduction in staking rewards
- **Consistency Bonus**: Low variance players get full multiplier
- **Minimum Floor**: 20% minimum multiplier regardless of performance

## üìà Supply Management System

### Supply Categories
- **Total Supply**: Fixed at 50M tokens (can only decrease through burns)
- **Circulating Supply**: Available for trading (decreases with burns, increases with emissions)
- **Locked Supply**: Tokens staked in the protocol (moves between circulating and locked)

### Supply Flow Mechanics
```
// Staking
circulatingSupply -= stakeAmount
lockedSupply += stakeAmount

// Unstaking
lockedSupply -= stakeAmount
circulatingSupply += stakeAmount

// Burning from treasury
protocolTreasury -= burnAmount
circulatingSupply -= burnAmount

// Emitting to treasury
protocolTreasury += emissionAmount
circulatingSupply += emissionAmount
```

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### Key Contracts
- **PlayerToken.sol**: Main contract with enhanced tokenomics
- **Enhanced API**: Complete interface for all new features
- **Frontend Components**: Updated UI for new functionality

### Protocol Treasury System
The protocol now implements a **treasury-based tokenomics system** that protects user holdings while creating meaningful supply dynamics:

#### Treasury Operations
- **Treasury Source**: Trading fees (0.25%) + optional owner contributions
- **Burn Source**: Protocol treasury (never user balances)
- **Emission Destination**: Protocol treasury (never user balances)
- **Reward Source**: Trading fees + treasury funds

#### User Protection
- **No Balance Touching**: User token holdings are never burned or emitted
- **Staking Safety**: Staked tokens remain safe from burns/emissions
- **Reward Security**: Rewards come from treasury, not user balances

#### Flywheel Mechanism
```
User buys player token ‚Üí User stakes token (optional) ‚Üí Staked tokens get treasury rewards ‚Üí 
Treasury supply influenced by player performance ‚Üí Staking multiplier based on performance ‚Üí 
Users get rewards from trading fees + treasury ‚Üí Users buy more tokens with deflationary supply
```
