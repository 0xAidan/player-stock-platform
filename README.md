# Player Stock - NFT-Based Sports Prediction Platform

A revolutionary NFT-based sports prediction platform that combines the best elements of Polymarket, DraftKings, and DeFi. Users buy NFT "shares" representing NFL players, compete in weekly performance-based competitions, and earn rewards based on their predictive accuracy.

## üöÄ Core Innovations

### 1. **Dynamic NFT Share System**
- **Limited Supply**: Each NFL player has a fixed base supply of NFT shares
- **Performance-Based Issuance**: Weekly share issuance based on player performance
- **Bonding Curve Sales**: Tuesday/Wednesday distribution of new shares
- **Hybrid Trading**: AMM + marketplace for optimal liquidity

### 2. **Position-Weighted Scoring**
- **Research-Based Weights**: QB (1.2x), RB (1.0x), WR (0.9x), TE (0.8x), K (0.7x)
- **Consistency Multipliers**: Rewards consistent performers
- **Fair Comparison**: Accounts for natural variance between positions
- **Historical Data**: Driven by 5+ seasons of performance analysis

### 3. **Weekly Competition System**
- **Lineup Locking**: Users lock in 5-player lineups weekly
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time scoring vs. league average
- **Leaderboard Creation**: Performance-based rankings
- **Reward Distribution**: Top performers earn trading fee percentages

## üìä Dynamic Supply Management

### Performance-Based Share Issuance
```
Weekly Share Issuance = Base Supply √ó (1 + Performance Penalty)

Where:
- Performance Penalty = (League Average - Player Average) / League Average
- Rolling Average = Last 4 weeks performance
- Bonding Curve = Tuesday/Wednesday distribution
```

### Supply Flow Mechanics
```
// Bad performers get more shares (lower prices)
if (playerPerformance < leagueAverage) {
    newShares = baseSupply * (1 + (leagueAverage - playerPerformance) / leagueAverage);
}

// Good performers maintain scarcity (higher prices)
if (playerPerformance >= leagueAverage) {
    newShares = baseSupply * 0.5; // Reduced issuance
}
```

### Example Supply Scenarios
- **Elite Performer** (150% of league average): 500 new shares
- **Average Performer** (100% of league average): 1000 new shares
- **Below Average** (80% of league average): 1200 new shares
- **Poor Performer** (60% of league average): 1400 new shares

## üéØ Position-Weighted Performance Scoring

### Adjusted Score Formula
```
Adjusted Score = Raw PPR √ó Position Weight √ó Consistency Multiplier

Position Weights (Research-Based):
- QB: 1.2 (Higher variance, higher weight)
- RB: 1.0 (Baseline)
- WR: 0.9 (More consistent, lower weight)
- TE: 0.8 (Most consistent, lowest weight)
- K: 0.7 (Very consistent, minimal weight)
```

### Consistency Multiplier
```
Consistency Multiplier = 1 + (Standard Deviation Bonus - Variance Penalty)

Where:
- Standard Deviation Bonus = Up to 0.3 for consistent performers
- Variance Penalty = Up to 0.2 for volatile performers
```

## üîÑ Hybrid AMM + Marketplace System

### AMM Pricing Mechanism
```
AMM Price = Average(Marketplace Sell Orders) √ó (1 - Discount)

Features:
- Market-driven pricing
- 5-10% discount for instant liquidity
- Tuesday/Wednesday bonding curve redistribution
- Dynamic adjustment based on performance
```

### Trading Options
- **Instant Sale**: AMM provides immediate liquidity at discount
- **Marketplace**: Secondary trading for better prices
- **Bonding Curve**: Tuesday/Wednesday new share sales
- **Limit Orders**: Advanced trading features

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### Key Contracts
- **PlayerShares.sol**: Main NFT contract with dynamic supply
- **WeeklyCompetition.sol**: Competition and reward management
- **AMM.sol**: Automated market maker for instant liquidity
- **Marketplace.sol**: Secondary trading platform

### Core Data Structures
```solidity
struct PlayerShare {
    uint256 totalSupply;        // Fixed base supply
    uint256 circulatingSupply;  // Available for trading
    uint256 reservedSupply;     // Held for new users
    uint256 currentPrice;       // AMM calculated price
    uint256 weeklyPerformance;  // Current week score
    uint256 rollingAverage;     // 4-week average
    uint256 positionWeight;     // Position-specific weight
    uint256 lastIssuance;       // Last issuance timestamp
}

struct WeeklyEntry {
    address user;
    address[] players;          // Max 5 players per lineup
    uint256[] shareAmounts;     // Shares of each player
    uint256 totalScore;         // Performance vs average
    uint256 rewardTier;         // 1-10 based on performance
}
```

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Trading Fees**: 0.25% on all marketplace transactions
2. **AMM Discount**: 5-10% spread on instant sales
3. **Bonding Curve Sales**: Revenue from new share issuance
4. **Performance Fees**: Optional fees on reward distributions

### Reward Distribution
```
Weekly Reward Pool = Trading Fees + AMM Revenue + Bonding Curve Revenue

Distribution Tiers:
- Tier 1 (Top 10%): 50% of pool
- Tier 2 (11-25%): 25% of pool  
- Tier 3 (26-50%): 15% of pool
- Tier 4 (51-75%): 10% of pool
```

### Performance Scoring
```
Performance Ratio = Player Score / League Average Score

Rewards:
- Ratio > 1.0: Receive rewards based on tier
- Ratio < 1.0: No rewards for that week
- Scaling: Higher ratios = higher tier placement
```

## üéÆ User Experience
